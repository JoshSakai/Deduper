#test cases in order

#read has UMI not in our index so toss it

#first read
#different UMI so not a dup
#reverse complemented and the initial read is not, so not a dup
#contains Ns so map was taken from different parts in the read, so not a dup

#second read
#left clipping but a dup
#right clipping but a dup
#left and right clipping but a dup
#contains Ns so map was taken from different parts in the read, so not a dup

#third read, starts reverse complemented
#has deletions, left, and right most soft clipping but a dup

#forth read, exact same as first read but on a different chromosome so not a dup
